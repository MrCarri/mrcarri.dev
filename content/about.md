# Hi there! I'm Carri, a Software Engineer.

I'm a software engineer based on Barcelona, Spain. I work as a backend developer implementing AI solutions, and I really like to create and build my own things. This blog is my personal laboratory where I document everything that I do.

My hobbies include indoor bouldering and rope climbing. I'm really into reading mystery books and 3D printing.
