# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how MrCarri.dev collects and processes data when you use this website.

The data controller and owner of this website is Alexandre Carrillo (MrCarri), based in Barcelona, Spain.

## 1. Data Collected (Logs and Hosting)

### 1.1 First-Party Log Data (Self-Hosting and Nginx/Caddy)

The hosting server (Mac Mini) uses a standard web server (e.g., Nginx or Caddy) to process traffic from the Cloudflare Tunnel. This server automatically collects access logs for purely **functional purposes** (stability, security, and error monitoring).

These functional logs may contain technical data such as:

* Your (proxied) IP address.
* Browser type and version.
* Timestamp of the request.

This data is stored locally in Barcelona, Spain, and is **deleted periodically** (e.g., monthly) as it is not used for personal tracking or analytics.

### 1.2 Third-Party Log Data (Cloudflare)

This website uses **Cloudflare Tunnel** for secure delivery. Cloudflare acts as a proxy and may collect and process log data, including IP addresses, to provide security services and prevent DDoS attacks. This data is handled according to the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.

## 2. Data Collected (Scripts Requiring Consent)

We use a strict consent mechanism (GDPR-compliant cookie banner) to only load the following third-party services after you explicitly consent:

| Service | Data Collected | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google Analytics** | Anonymous user behaviour data (page views, session duration, referral source). Your IP address is potentially processed by Google. | To analyze traffic and improve content based on reader interest. |
| **Buy Me a Coffee** | Data necessary to display the donation widget and process payments/donations (handled via their external platform). | To provide a means for voluntary reader support. |

If you click "Deny" or manage your preferences, these services will **not** be loaded.

## 3. Data Storage and Fonts

### 3.1 Data Storage

All first-party data (server logs) is stored locally on the server in Barcelona, Spain. We do not use permanent or essential cookies for functionality.

### 3.2 Fonts

This website uses **system fonts** only. No external services are called to load typography, ensuring that your IP address is not shared with any third party for font delivery.

---

## 4. Your Rights (GDPR)

As a data subject, you have the right to access, rectify, restrict processing, or erase your data. Since we do not store identifying data (we rely on anonymized/consented third-party services), exercising these rights applies mainly to data stored in our server logs or transmitted to consented third parties.
