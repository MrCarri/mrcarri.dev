# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how MrCarri.dev collects and processes data. This site is designed with a "privacy-first" approach, focusing on transparency and minimal data collection.

The data controller and owner of this website is Alexandre Carrillo (MrCarri), based in Barcelona, Spain.

## 1. Data Collection and Hosting

### 1.1 Infrastructure (GitHub Pages)

This website is hosted using **GitHub Pages**. When you visit this site, GitHub may collect and process standard web server logs (including your IP address, browser type, and timestamp) to ensure the security and integrity of the service. 

As the website owner, I do not have direct access to these raw server logs. This data is handled according to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

### 1.2 Privacy-Friendly Analytics (GoatCounter)

I use **GoatCounter** to understand how many people visit the site and which articles are the most popular. I chose this tool because:
* **No Cookies:** It does not use cookies or local storage to track you.
* **No Personal Data:** It does not collect IP addresses or any other personally identifiable information (PII). It uses a de-identified hash to distinguish unique visits for a short period.
* **Open Source:** You can audit exactly what it does.

This monitoring is based on **legitimate interest** (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) to improve the content of the blog without compromising user privacy.

## 2. Tracking and Cookies

This website **does not use tracking cookies, marketing cookies, or persistent identifiers**. Because no non-essential personal data is processed and no cookies are used for tracking, a consent banner is not required under GDPR/ePrivacy regulations.

## 3. External Services and Fonts

### 3.1 Fonts
This website uses **system fonts** only. No requests are made to third-party services like Google Fonts, ensuring your IP address is not shared with third parties for typography delivery.

### 3.2 Ethical Ads (Future Integration)
In the future, this site may display ads through privacy-focused networks (like EthicalAds). These networks are selected specifically because they do not use cookies or tracking, relying instead on the **context** of the page you are reading.

---

## 4. Your Rights (GDPR)

Under the GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data held about you. However, since this website **does not store identifying information** about its visitors (no databases, no accounts, anonymized analytics), I generally cannot identify specific users to fulfill such requests.

**Contact:** If you have any questions, please contact the data controller:
